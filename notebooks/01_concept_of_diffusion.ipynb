    "Welcome to the **Stable Diffusion Engineering Course**. This is notebook 1 of 20.\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "In this first lesson, we won't write complex code yet. We will understand the **Core Intuition** behind diffusion: **Order from Chaos**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Diffusion?\n",
    "Imagine dropping a drop of ink into a glass of water. Over time, the ink *diffuses* until the water is uniformly colored. It turns from a structured state (drop) to a chaotic state (mix).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generative Diffusion** is the *math of reversing time*. If we could mathematically \"un-mix\" the water, we could get the ink drop back.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AI:\n",
    "1.  **Forward Process (Training)**: Take an image (e.g., a cat) and slowly add noise until it is pure static.\n",
    "2.  **Reverse Process (Inference)**: Take pure static and ask a Neural Network to predict \"what noise was added?\" and subtract it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize this Forward Process!"
